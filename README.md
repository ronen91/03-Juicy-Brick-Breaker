# Project Name

Context and date: This game was created February 23 2023, and was assigned as a project at Indiana University.

Description: It's classic brick breaker, but you play as a monster who's bouncing his own left eye around! Ouch!

To play

Move the paddle using the mouse. Release the ball (and trigger fever mode) using the left mouse button. Assist the ball in breaking all the bricks before you run out of time.

## Implementation

Built using Godot 3.5.1

Face, ball, and paddle sprites created by me using Piskel.com.

Music created by me using MuseScore 4.

Somethings I did to this game were:

- Changing the colors
- Squeeze and stretch
- Animate elements when they are hit
- give the ball (or eye) a comet trail
- Shake the screen when something good happens
- Shake the screen when an error occurs
- Add sound effects
- Add music
- Animate the bricks' appearance
- Add particles when an element is hit
- Make the elements fall off the screen when they are hit
- Make the elements rotate when they are hit
- Add eyes (or an eye)
- Make the eye follow the action
- Add a smile
- Add a background to the main screen
- Add shaders
